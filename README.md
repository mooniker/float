Float Messenger is web-based instant messaging server and client software built on the MEAN stack.

## Why 'Float'?

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_(project_management)), "**float** or **slack** is the amount of time that a task in a project network can be delayed without causing a delay" to subsequent tasks or project completion. The challenge herein is keeping it buoyant (or not giving it too much _slack_).
